hacky way to get some useful metrics from jira

# install
- create a jira token (if you don't have one already) -> https://id.atlassian.com/manage/api-tokens
- run `yarn`
- create an `.env` file with configs from `.env.test` but tailored to you - use your token as `JIRA_PASSWORD`

# run
- `yarn start`
