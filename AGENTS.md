# Project Instructions

## Code Style

-   Do not use inline comments to explain what the code is doing. In rare cases, it is ok to use an inline comment to explain _why_ the code is doing something special.
-   Do not use `any` for type definitions, except in one-off scripts or tests.
-   Keep functions < 50 LoC
-   Keep files < 500 LoC
-   Classes/modules have a single responsibility. Split when new reasons to change appear.
